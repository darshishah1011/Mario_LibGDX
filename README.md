# Mario_LibGDX
Created Test project for Java course under professor Joseph Fowler


I decided to work on Side Scroller Project and create a game like Mario
This is the first time I am working on game development thus I spent most of the time researching on game development and LibGDX
I set up IntelliJ and LibGDX on my machine 
For this submission I created a small Mario sprite image on screen which navigates to different positions based on mouse click event
I worked on two class files: Game2 and ThrustFish
You can compile and execute the files under the core folder and run on desktop
